# Data & Preparation

Before you start working with G3W-SUITE, it‚Äôs important to prepare both your QGIS project and its underlying data. This section walks you through the setup process ‚Äî customizing the project, exploring the dataset, and getting everything ready for a smooth WebGIS deployment.

<br>

By the end of this tutorial, you will have practical experience in:

1. **Customizing** the visual and functional components of a QGIS project
2. **Publishing** the project as a WebGIS service using G3W-SUITE
3. **Creating** custom search tools for fast, focused data queries
4. **Integrating** interactive charts with the DataPlotly plugin
5. **Enabling** online editing capabilities

## Data

We‚Äôll be working with a modified dataset of central Berlin, extracted via the BBBike OSM Extract Service. The pre-configured QGIS project and database are bundled for convenience:

- [<span class="ui-filename">Tutorial_Data_G3WSUITE.zip</span>](https://github.com/kartoza/GeoHosting-Documentation/docs/src/products/manual_data/Tutorial_Data_G3WSUITE.zip)

<br>

Once extracted, the folder contains 3 images and the following structure:

- üìÅ **plots** ‚Äì Chart configurations for the DataPlotly plugin in <span class="ui-filename">.xml</span> format
- üìÅ **project_data** ‚Äì Includes the SpatiaLite database: <span class="ui-filename">g3w_tutorial.sqlite</span>
- üìÅ **projects** ‚Äì The QGIS project file: <span class="ui-filename">g3w_tutorial.qgs</span>

<br>

Before publishing a project to G3W-SUITE, these two steps need to be completed:

1. **Update the QGIS Project Title**

    This will be used as the WebGIS service ID. Leaving it unchanged may cause confusion or service conflicts.

2. **Upload the SpatiaLite Database to the File Manager**

    G3W-SUITE needs access to your actual data source. If the database isn't uploaded, your layers may not load correctly.

## Data Preperation

To update your QGIS project title:

1. Navigate to the <span class="ui-page-label">Project Properties</span> of your QGIS project. 

2. Under the <span class="ui-page-label">General</span> tab, and find the <span class="ui-filename">Project Title</span> field. 

3. Enter a unique and descriptive title for your project.

4. Click <span class="ui-generic-label">OK</span> to apply the changes.

<br>

Make sure your title:

- Clearly describes the content or purpose of the project
- Avoids special characters or long whitespace
- Is short, but specific enough to identify in G3W

**Next up:** Now that your project title is updated, we'll walk you through how to upload your SpatiaLite database to G3W-SUITE so your project layers display correctly.
