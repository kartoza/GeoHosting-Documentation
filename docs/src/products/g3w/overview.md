# G3W Overview

## Why Choose this Product?

G3W-SUITE is an advanced WebGIS management system that brings the full capabilities of QGIS into a user-friendly, browser-based platform. Designed to simplify the publication, access, and editing of geospatial data, it provides a streamlined, modular solution that adapts to a wide range of user needs — from individual GIS analysts to large organizations. Here’s what sets it apart:

- **Seamless QGIS integration**

    G3W-SUITE lets you publish your QGIS projects directly to the web as fully compliant OGC services, eliminating the need for any conversion or duplication of effort. What you build in QGIS is exactly what gets served.

    <br>

- **Fully open-source stack**

    Built entirely on open standards and technologies — QGIS, Django, Python, and OGC protocols — G3W-SUITE ensures transparency, extensibility, and freedom from licensing constraints or proprietary limitations.

    <br>

- **Customisable theming and access control**

    Organise your WebGIS services into thematic categories, configure visibility and functionality per user or group, and define precise permissions using role-based access control and ACL mechanisms.

    <br>

- **Advanced editing and search tools**

    Empower users to edit spatial features directly within the browser, configure various search modes tailored to your datasets, and expand capabilities by activating additional functional modules as needed.
