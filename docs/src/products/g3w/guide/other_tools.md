# Integrating With Other Tools

G3W-SUITE supports a range of widgets and external tools that can enhance your published QGIS projects. These integrations allow you to provide a more dynamic and interactive experience for users, from advanced search functionality to powerful data visualizations.

<br>

## Search Widget

To add a Search Widget to your project, go to the <span class="ui-page-label">Layers List</span>. Click the <span class="ui-generic-label">Widgets List</span> icon next to the desired layer, then select <span class="ui-generic-label">Add New Widget</span>. In the configuration window, choose <span class="ui-generic-label">Search</span> from the <span class="ui-filename">Type</span> dropdown. 

<br>

You'll then need to fill out the following fields:

<table class="my-table-style">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Field</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>Label that appears to end users</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Search Title</td>
      <td>Internal name of the widget</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Search Field Settings</td>
      <td>Field or expression to search against</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

Click <span class="ui-generic-label">Ok</span> to apply the widget to your layer.

Then click <span class="ui-generic-label">New Qplotly Widget</span>. Upload a preconfigured DataPlotly <span class="ui-filename">.xml</span> file for your desired chart or graph, and confirm with <span class="ui-generic-label">Ok</span>.
