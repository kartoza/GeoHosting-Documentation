# First Log In & Setting Your Password

## Accessing the Portal

To begin exploring your new G3W-SUITE product, navigate to the <span class="ui-page-label">Hosted Products</span> section of the GSH Dashboard and click the <span class="ui-generic-label">Product Name</span> you selected during setup.

Alternatively, you can access your product directly using its URL, which is available under the <span class="ui-page-label">Product Details</span> page.

## Logging In

To access the Administration Panel, you'll first need to log in using the credentials generated on the GSH Dashboard. From the G3W Portal, click <span class="ui-page-label">Login</span> in the side panel. Enter your **Username** (<span class="ui-filename">admin</span>) and the **Password** copied from the dashboard. Click <span class="ui-generic-label">Login</span> to proceed.

After logging in, you'll be redirected back to the <span class="ui-page-label">Portal</span>, but youâ€™ll now see <span class="ui-page-label">Admin</span> in the side panel instead of the Login option.

## Accessing the Administration Panel

The Administration Panel is the control center for managing user accounts, groups, and access policies. To open it, click <span class="ui-page-label">Admin</span> in the side panel, then select either <span class="ui-generic-label">Backend</span> or <span class="ui-generic-label">Administration</span>.

## Changing Your Password

Itâ€™s a good practice to update your password regularly to maintain account security.

In the administration panel, click your <span class="ui-generic-label">Username</span> in the top navigation bar. Select <span class="ui-generic-label">Profile</span> from the dropdown. Scroll down to the <span class="ui-page-label">Login Data</span> section, and enter your new password twice. Click <span class="ui-generic-label">Save</span> to apply the changes.
