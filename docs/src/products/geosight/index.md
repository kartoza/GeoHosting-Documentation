# GeoSight: Geospatial Risk Analysis and Visualization

**GeoSight** is an open-source geospatial visualization and data analysis platform developed by **UNICEF**. It aims to support decision-making by providing both experts and non-experts with easy access to powerful tools for understanding and analyzing data. These include deprivation indicators, exposure to hazards at subnational levels, and early warnings.

**GeoSight** is linked to an administrative boundary management system called **GeoRepo**. GeoRepo enables users to reconcile differences and track changes in administrative areas over time while maintaining an up-to-date global dataset of administrative boundaries, at least down to the second administrative level. In **GeoSight**, GeoRepo ensures compatibility between all indicators, facilitating seamless analysis.  

### **Key Features**  

- **Indicators** – Datasets assigned to administrative boundaries, visualized using flexible pre-set color rules.  
- **Context Layers** – Geospatial data that is not constrained by administrative boundaries, including point or raster layers.  
- **Widgets** – Summary graphs or figures that highlight key aspects of an indicator dataset.  
- **Trend Analysis** – Visualizes changes in indicators over time.  
- **Filters** – Tools to isolate and display administrative areas based on defined thresholds.  
- **Analysis Tools** – Advanced tools, such as 3D display and compare layers, that help users explore data relationships.  
- **Batch Management Tools** – Enables classification and formatting of multiple indicators simultaneously.  
- **Access Controls** – Provides granular control over data visibility, down to individual users and datasets.  
- **Interoperability** – Supports data ingestion from other systems and enables seamless data sharing.  
- **Low Costs** – As open-source software, GeoSight incurs zero licensing fees.  

### **Communicating with External Platforms and Information Sharing**  

GeoSight integrates with external platforms through **Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)**, which act as gateways for seamless data exchange.  

- **Incorporating External Data** – Users can connect external datasets to GeoSight, either as **context layers** (e.g., a natural hazard early warning system) or as **indicators**, provided they align with appropriate administrative boundaries.  
- **Sharing Data** – GeoSight features its own API, allowing it to share data with other geospatial platforms. Users can also easily download all indicators in widely used formats such as **Excel**.  
- **Interoperability** – A key design principle of GeoSight, ensuring smooth data integration and exchange across multiple systems.  

### **GeoSight and the CCRI-DRM**  

GeoSight enables users to **analyse and visualise** **Child Climate Risk Index – Disaster Risk Model (CCRI-DRM)** indicators and scores through an interactive online dashboard while providing access to all of GeoSight’s advanced features.  

With **subnational analysis**, users can examine sectoral deprivations and hazard exposure, as well as their combined impact, to identify high-risk areas within a country. Additionally, GeoSight can integrate real-time data, such as **cyclone or flood warnings** and **recent conflict events**, to help users assess how current or near-future conditions intersect with vulnerability.  

These analytical capabilities, combined with tools like filters, help users **understand situational context** and **target areas of concern** to support children, families, and communities through **risk-informed, resilient programming** and **emergency preparedness**. By clearly identifying risks and their causes, GeoSight ensures that **no one is left behind**.  

On GeoSight, **the CCRI-DRM enables cross-sector collaboration**, allowing partners with different roles to share a **common risk assessment framework** and coordinate strategic planning. It also supports **advocacy, partnership building, and resource mobilisation**.  

### **Four Ways to Use GeoSight and CCRI-DRM Data**  

GeoSight’s interoperability allows UNICEF country teams and partners to engage in **information sharing** through four key methods:  

1. **UNICEF GeoSight Dashboard Instance**  
   - A country-specific dashboard, hosted on UNICEF servers, with full access to all features.  

2. **External GeoSight Dashboard Instance**  
   - As an open-source platform, anyone can install and customise a GeoSight instance on local servers at no cost.  

3. **Data Sharing with External Platforms**  
   - GeoSight can send data via **API** to other mapping platforms already in use.  

4. **Embedding GeoSight Data**  
   - Users can **copy and paste a URL** to embed GeoSight visualisations in any website.
