# GeoServer

## What is GeoServer?

**GeoServer** is a powerful, Java-based server application that enables users to publish, edit, and share geospatial data. Built on open standards set by the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/), it promotes interoperability and flexibility in map creation and spatial data management.

## Publish and Share Spatial Data

GeoServer enables you to publish spatial data on the web using open standards like the **Web Map Service (WMS)**. It can generate maps in a variety of output formats and works seamlessly with OpenLayers, a widely-used open-source web mapping library.

<br>

In addition to WMS, GeoServer supports several other OGC services:

      <th>Purpose</th>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Web Map Service</td>
      <td>WMS</td>
      <td>Serves dynamic map images rendered from spatial data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Web Feature Service</td>
      <td>WFS</td>
      <td>Provides access to and editing of vector (feature) data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Web Coverage Service</td>
      <td>WCS</td>
      <td>Shares raster data (coverages) such as satellite imagery or elevation grids.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Web Map Tile Service</td>
      <td>WMTS</td>
      <td>Delivers pre-rendered map tiles for fast performance in web and mobile applications.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Web Processing Service</td>
      <td>WPS</td>
      <td>Enables server-side geospatial processing and analysis of data.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<br>

GeoServer‚Äôs modular architecture allows you to expand its capabilities through extensions. The WPS extension, for example, unlocks powerful on-the-fly geoprocessing. You can also create your own custom plugins to suit specific workflows.

By publishing data through GeoServer, you empower others to access and embed your spatial content in websites, applications, and platforms ‚Äî promoting open access, collaboration, and transparency.

<br>

## Built on Free and Open Source Software

GeoServer is fully open source and free to use, significantly lowering the cost of entry compared to proprietary GIS platforms. Its open development model invites contributions from the global community, ensuring ongoing improvements, quick bug fixes, and steady evolution.

With no vendor lock-in and full access to the source code, GeoServer empowers users with flexibility, long-term sustainability, and independence from restrictive licensing.

## Seamless Integration With Mapping APIs

GeoServer works beautifully with leading open-source mapping libraries like [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com), allowing you to build rich, interactive web maps using open tools.

<br>

It can also serve spatial data to a wide range of platforms and tools, including:

- [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/)
- [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/)
- [Microsoft Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps)
- [MapBox](http://mapbox.com)
- [ESRI ArcGIS](http://mapbox.com)

<br>

This makes GeoServer a highly interoperable solution for modern GIS and web mapping workflows.
