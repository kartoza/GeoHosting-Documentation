# GeoServer

## What is GeoServer?

GeoServer is a Java-based server that enables users to view, edit, and share geospatial data. Built on open standards defined by the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/), it offers powerful flexibility for map creation and data interoperability.

## Open and Share Your Spatial Data

GeoServer allows you to share your spatial data with the world by implementing the [Web Map Service (WMS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms) standard. It can generate maps in various output formats, and integrates with [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/), a free mapping library, making map creation fast and straightforward. GeoServer itself is built on [GeoTools](http://geotools.org), an open-source Java GIS toolkit.

GeoServer also supports the [Web Feature Service (WFS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs) and [Web Coverage Service (WCS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs) standards, enabling data sharing and editing. Additionally, it uses the [Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts) standard to serve map tiles optimized for web and mobile apps.

The platform is modular, with extra capabilities available through extensions. For example, the [Web Processing Service (WPS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps) extension unlocks powerful geospatial processing featuresâ€”and you can even create your own custom extensions!

By using GeoServer, you empower others to embed your data in their websites and applications, promoting open access and greater transparency.

## Use Free and Open Source Software

GeoServer is [free software](/license), which significantly reduces the financial barrier to entry compared to proprietary GIS solutions. Being open-source, GeoServer allows the community to transparently and efficiently contribute bug fixes and feature enhancements. This openness helps prevent vendor lock-in, ultimately saving costs on long-term support and licensing contracts.

## Integrate With Mapping APIs

We recommend both [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) as excellent open-source web mapping libraries. When combined with GeoServer, they provide a powerful, fully open-source solution for web mapping.

GeoServer can also serve spatial data to popular mapping platforms, including:

- [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/)
- [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com/)
- [Microsoft Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps)
- [MapBox](http://mapbox.com)

Additionally, GeoServer integrates smoothly with traditional GIS architectures such as [ESRI ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/arcgis).

## Join the Community

GeoServer benefits from a large and active global community of users and developers, providing support through multiple channels such as [email lists](/comm#email). It maintains a regular [release cycle](/roadmap) and a [public issue tracker](/issues), ensuring transparency and consistent updates. Additionally, commercial support is available from various providers, so with GeoServer, you are always backed by a strong and supportive community.
