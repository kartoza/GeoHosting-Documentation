# Other Useful Tools

## Dashboard

**Dashboard** is a **MapStore tool** integrated into GeoNode that provides users with a flexible workspace where they can add multiple widgets such as charts, maps, tables, text, and counters. Dashboards allow users to create interactive connections between these widgets to achieve the following:

- Provide a **visual overview** to better understand a specific data context.
- Enable **spatial and analytical interactions** with the data through widget connections.
- Perform **data analysis** across the included datasets and layers.

## GeoStories

**GeoStory** is a **MapStore tool** integrated into GeoNode that enables users to create inspiring and immersive stories by combining text, interactive maps, and other multimedia content such as images, videos, or third-party content. This tool makes it easy to tell engaging stories on the web, which can then be published and shared with specific groups of GeoNode users or made public worldwide.

GeoNode allows you to enrich your GeoStory with **internal GeoNode documents and maps** as well as **external sources**. This integration makes GeoStory a highly useful feature for storytelling.
