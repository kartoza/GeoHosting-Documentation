# Uploading Datasets

In GeoNode, **datasets** are core resources that represent either **vector** or **raster** spatial data. Each dataset includes metadata and supports user collaboration through comments and ratings. Uploading datasets is a key part of sharing spatial content on your GeoNode instance.

<br>

You can start the upload process in two places:

- From the **All Resources** page via **Add Resource → Upload dataset**
- From the **Datasets** page via **New → Upload dataset**

<br>

## Step 1: Access the Dataset Page

From the GeoNode **Homepage**, click the **Datasets** tab. Then, click the **New button** and select **Upload dataset** from the dropdown.

<br>

## Step 2: Select and Upload Files

On the **Upload a Dataset** page, click **Select files...** and choose the 5 componenets of the `landuse` shapefile in the `Data` folder. Once selected, click **Upload**.

GeoNode will show a progress bar as the files are uploaded and unpacked.

## Step 3: View Your Dataset

Once the upload is complete, click **View** to open your newly published dataset. This opens the **Dataset Detail Page**, where you can:

- Browse the data on a map
- See and edit metadata
- Download the original files
- Comment or rate the dataset
