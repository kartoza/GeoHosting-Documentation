# Geonode Help

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Why does my layer break when I upload it?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    Layer names with special or non-standard characters (e.g., em dashes, smart quotes) can cause errors.  
    <br><br>
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Use only standard ASCII characters like regular hyphens (-), letters, and numbers.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Why are duplicate layers created when pushing from QGIS?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    Pushing edits from the original QGIS layer again after pushing creates duplicates.  
    <br><br>
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Close the original QGIS layer after pushing, then fetch the layer from GeoNode and edit that to avoid duplicates.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>My uploaded layer doesn’t show up in GeoNode — what’s wrong?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    It might be an import error or file format issue. Check if your file is zipped properly and in a supported format like Shapefile or GeoPackage. Also, verify upload logs for errors.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>I get an error about geometry types when uploading a layer, how to fix it?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    GeoNode expects consistent geometry types. For example, a "LineString" layer should not contain "MultiLineString" features.  
    <br><br>
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Use QGIS’s "Multipart to Singleparts" tool or similar to ensure geometries are consistent before upload.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Why can’t I see certain layers or maps on the public site?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    The layer or map might be private or restricted. Check the “Sharing” permissions and ensure the "Anonymous Users" group has view rights if you want public access.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>I uploaded a zipped shapefile, but it’s missing attributes — why?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    Make sure all required components of the shapefile (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj) are included in the ZIP file. If even one is missing, GeoNode may not import it correctly.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>My layer appears blank in the map viewer — what’s wrong?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    Your layer might be outside the current map extent or missing a coordinate reference system (CRS).  
    <br><br>
    <strong>Fix:</strong> Check your layer in QGIS, reproject it to EPSG:4326 if needed, and re-upload.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Upload fails with a "timeout" or "server error"</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    Large files can cause timeouts or memory issues. Try simplifying geometries or reducing file size. If the problem persists, contact your GeoNode administrator for upload limits or server logs.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Styling changes in the map viewer aren’t saving</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    After applying style changes, make sure you click the **Save** button in the map composer. Also confirm you have edit permissions for the map or layer.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>I can’t upload a layer due to a “duplicate name” error</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    GeoNode does not allow two layers with the same name. Rename your layer in QGIS or during the upload process to ensure it’s unique.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How do I update an existing layer on GeoNode via QGIS?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    Fetch the existing layer from GeoNode using the plugin, make your edits on this fetched layer, then push your changes back to GeoNode to update without creating duplicates.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>What file formats can I upload to GeoNode?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    GeoNode supports zipped Shapefiles, GeoPackages, and CSVs with geometry columns. Ensure your data matches one of these for successful uploads.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How do I set permissions for my layers and maps?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">

  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Can I create maps combining multiple layers?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    Yes! You can create composite maps by adding multiple layers in the GeoNode map viewer. Save your map to share or publish it.

</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How can I delete a layer or map from GeoNode?</summary>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>How do I change the coordinate system of a layer?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    Use QGIS to reproject the layer to a standard CRS like EPSG:4326 before uploading. GeoNode relies on consistent spatial references for accurate display and analysis.
  </div>
</details>

<details class="faq-item">
  <summary>Can I collaborate with teammates on a shared map?</summary>
  <div class="faq-answer">
    Yes. Set map and layer permissions to allow viewing or editing by specific users or groups. Use the "Sharing" tab on each resource’s page to configure access.
