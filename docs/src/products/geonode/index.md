# GeoNode

## What is GeoNode?

**GeoNode** is an open-source **geospatial content management system (CMS)** for managing, sharing, and publishing geospatial data and interactive maps via a web interface.

It integrates **data creation, metadata editing, and map visualization** in one platform, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users. GeoNode allows datasets to be shared publicly or restricted to specific users.

It also includes **social features** like user profiles, commenting, and rating to support collaboration and data quality control. GeoNode is **flexible and developer-friendly**, making it easy to extend, customize, or integrate into other applications.
