   - Choose the package that meets your requirements.

## Viewing Purchased Instances

All your purchased services can be managed under **Instances**:

1. **Access the Instances Page**
   - From the main menu, click **Instances**.
   - A list of your active (and possibly suspended/expired) instances is displayed.

2. **Instance Details**
   - Click on any instance to see resource usage, IP addresses, billing info, and status (Running, Stopped, etc.).

3. **Instance Actions**
   - **Start / Stop / Restart**: If the instance supports manual control, use these buttons to manage uptime.
   - **Settings / Configuration**: Manage SSH keys or passwords, depending on the platform’s features.

4. **Billing / Agreement Reference**
   - Each instance is tied to an agreement or subscription. Make note of the relevant ID for support or cancellations.

## Cancelling Agreements

If you need to discontinue a service or stop a subscription, follow these steps:

1. **Go to Agreements**
   - Click **Agreements** in the main menu.
   - You’ll see all active and historical agreements.

2. **Choose the Agreement**
   - Locate the agreement for the instance you want to cancel.
   - Click **View** or **Details** to open it.

3. **Confirm Cancellation**
   - Select **Cancel Agreement**, **Terminate**, or **End Subscription** (varies by interface).
   - A pop-up may prompt you to confirm cancellation and warn you about data loss.

4. **Next Steps**
   - Once cancelled, the instance is typically shut down and removed from your dashboard after a grace period (depending on terms).
   - Ensure you back up important data before cancelling.

> **Note**: Cancellation typically halts further billing. Always check if your data is retained or deleted immediately.
